* I am a first-year PhD student in [Computer Science department](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yongfeng Zhang](http://www.yongfeng.me/).
* My research interests lie at large language models (security issues of LLM, leveraging LLM for recommendation and tool learning)
